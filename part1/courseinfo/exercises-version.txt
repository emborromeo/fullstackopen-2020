The words fell with a hollow flatness on to 
Jay Cee's desk, like so many wooden nickels

Alan Turing
Do you know why people lke violence?
It is because it feels goof
Humans find violence deeply satisfying
But remove the satisfaction and the act becomes hollow

Can machines think?
Could machines ever think as human beings?
Machines can't think as people do
Machine is different from a person
Hence they think differently
The interesting question is, just because something thinks differently from you does that mean it's not thinking?

We allow for humans to have such divergences from one another
What is the point of differences tastes of different preferences
if not to say that our brains work differently
that we think differently?
And if we can say that about one another then why can't we say the same thing for brains built of copper and wires
